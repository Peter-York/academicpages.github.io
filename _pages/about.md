My aim is to transform the way **robotic tools** are deployed in **surgery**. I draw  on advances in microfabrication, millimeter-scale actuation and sensing, and compliant-mechanism synthesis and a broad suite of mechanical and electrical engineering skills.

My academic background is in mechanical engineering. As an undergraduate (BEng, Vanderbilt, 2014) I worked under Prof. Robert J. Webster in the [Vanderbilt Medical Engineering and Discovery Lab](http://research.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/MEDLab/), and as a graduate student (PhD, Harvard, 2020) I worked under Prof. Robert J. Wood in the [Harvard Microrobotics Lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu/). I am currently working at Medtronic on instrumentation for Hugo, the soft tissue robotic surgical system.

My work is summarized on this site, from projects to academic publications to teaching. Thanks for stopping by, and please reach out to me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-york-robotics/) if you're interested in connecting.
