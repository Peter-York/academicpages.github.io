This project was from my undergraduate senior design class, in which I led a group of five students in building a robotic system capable of tying a shoe. The project was proposed as being analogous to bomb-defusing tasks, in which remote operators use teleoperation to dexterously control robots for carefully disarming bombs. We developed both an end-to-end teleoperation system and a set of interchangeable mechanical graspers. We were one of the three out of approximately a dozen mechanical engineering design teams to be awarded a Design Award for "showing the most creativity and originality in their designs".

**Teleoperation:** This video shows the teleoperation of a two-armed 7-DOF robot using two Phantom Omni input devices:
