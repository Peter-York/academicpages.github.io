In this project, I showed how to design and fabricate flextensional piezoelectric actuators on the millimeter scale with similar performance at high transmission ratios as their centimeter-scale counterparts. These actuators convert the large tensile stresses 25 Pa*m/V and small displacements (0.1% strain) generated via the converse piezoelectric effect into larger displacements at the expense of output force. The quality of this conversion, termed "mechanical efficiency", is a key performance metric that I show how to optimize over five generations of actuator development, shown in the figure below. I provide simple guidelines based on lumped parameter modeling and scaling analysis to assist designers in sizing actuators to match specific size and output requirements.

This work enables new millimeter-scale systems and to facilitate the downscaling of existing centimeter-sized devices. These actuators can be used as building blocks in millimeter-sized devices in which precise, linear motion is needed, and the method of analysis employed should be broadly useful to designers of similar devices looking to distill a complex mechanics problem down to a set of simple design guidelines.

The potential applications for these devices on the millimeter scale are numerous, as judged by existing deployments in centimeter-sized systems. Claeyssen, et al. [1], describe a host of device applications: micro-scanning and shutter control for high-speed optical systems, active damping and shape control in aerodynamic systems, and acoustic sourcing for mapping underwater pipe networks and structural health monitoring. Janker, et al. [2] describe a wing morphing mechanism and vibration absorbers for helicopters and automobiles. Liu, et al. [3] and Lee, et al. [4] use flextensional actuators as the basis for in-plane and out-of-plane micropositioning stages, respectively.

**Laser micromachining:** This video shows the use of a galvo-operated UV laser to micromachine the carbon fiber amplification frame. This is the final step of device fabrication, in which the device is released from the multi-material laminate from which it is formed:

**Free displacement:** This clip shows the free (unloaded) motion of the actuator. For these type of devices, typical output displacements are ~50-100 um:

**Blocked force:** Next, this clip shows the other extreme of actuator performance: fully blocked output, in this case with a force sensor that allows the blocked force to be measured. Any internal motion of the actuator in this configuration represents loss in output work. Typical output force is ~50-100 mN:

**Spring load:** Lastly, this clip shows an intermediate loading condition: a spring load is attached to the output, and some intermediate force and displacement are achieved in between the extremes of free displacement and blocked force:

**Microgripper demonstration:** In this video, pincers are added to the flextensional actuator to enable grasping of small objects. This shows potential usage of this technology in micromanipulation applications:
